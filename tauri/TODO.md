# Cross-Platform Implementation TODO

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Implementation
- [x] Create `scripts/platform-utils.js` for platform detection
- [x] Update `package.json` with cross-platform scripts
- [x] Create `quick-dev.sh` for macOS/Linux development
- [x] Create `quick-build.sh` for macOS/Linux builds
- [x] Create `BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS_CROSS_PLATFORM.md`
- [x] Create `PLATFORM_SETUP.md`
- [x] Create `CROSS_PLATFORM_SUMMARY.md`
- [x] Create `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`

### Configuration
- [x] `tauri.conf.json` already configured for all platforms
- [x] `main.rs` works as-is (no platform-specific code needed)
- [x] Windows scripts (`quick-dev.bat`, `quick-build.bat`) already working

- [ ] Check for typos and formatting issues
- [ ] Ensure all links work correctly
- [ ] Update README.md with cross-platform information (if needed)

## üöÄ Distribution Tasks

- [ ] Create release notes for version 1.0.0
- [ ] Test installers on clean systems
- [ ] Document known issues (if any)
- [ ] Create distribution packages for each platform
- [ ] Test installation on multiple versions of each OS

## üìã Notes

### Platform-Specific Considerations

**Windows:**
- WebView2 required (pre-installed on Windows 11)
- Visual Studio Build Tools required for compilation
- Both MSI and NSIS installers are created

**macOS:**
- Xcode Command Line Tools required
- Code signing recommended for distribution
- Notarization required for macOS 10.15+
- Separate builds for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) and Intel

**Linux:**
- Different package formats for different distributions
- DEB for Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
- RPM for Fedora/RHEL-based systems
- AppImage works universally without installation

### Build Times

- First build: 10-30 minutes (Rust compilation)
- Subsequent builds: 1-5 minutes (cached)
- Development mode: Fast hot-reload

### File Sizes (Approximate)

- Windows MSI: ~5-10 MB
- Windows NSIS: ~5-10 MB
- macOS DMG: ~5-10 MB
- Linux DEB: ~5-10 MB
- Linux RPM: ~5-10 MB
- Linux AppImage: ~5-10 MB

## ‚ú® Future Enhancements

- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds
- [ ] Create universal macOS binary (Intel + Apple Silicon)
- [ ] Add code signing for Windows
- [ ] Add code signing for macOS
- [ ] Create auto-update mechanism
- [ ] Add crash reporting
- [ ] Create installer customization options

## üêõ Known Issues

None currently identified. Will update as testing progresses.
